# Build instructions
Build the PCB as usual using the [BOM](https://github.com/tommueller/UM-TSS/blob/master/schematics%20v1/BOM.ods?raw=true) **BUT** do not add caps: **C5, C7, C9, C12 and C13**. You can doublecheck with this image: ![](https://github.com/tommueller/UM-TSS/blob/master/schematics%20v1/pcb%20v1%20populated%20front.JPG?raw=true)

When you are finished with this, you need to do the following to get this up and running:

- at the back of the PCB solder a 8.2nF cap between the legs 1 & 7 of U4 and U5 each
- solder a 100nF cap between the legs 1 & 7 of U3
- add a little wire between pins 2 & 13 of U3
- take C9 (10uF) and solder it with its positive side to pin 12 of U3 and the negative side to the negative pad of C9

Again you can doublecheck with this image: ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tommueller/UM-TSS/master/schematics%20v1/pcb%20v1%20populated%20back.JPG)

## LED
The resistor for the led is not placed on the pcb. Please wire the led with a 1k resistor in series between + and GND. Do this behind the on/off-switch off course. The LED-mountin hole is 6mm, I used this [led mounting clips](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/3mm-bezel-led-panel-mounting-clip.html).

## DC in
The UM-TSS expects 9V input voltage. The LM7805 has a much wider range though, so anything between 9V and 15V shouldn't be a problem. I use this [dc power jack](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/dc-power-jack-2-1mm-enclosed-frame-with-switch-external.html).

## Wiring
Basically the wiring is self-explaining. Every section of the circuit has its own row of ins-/outs. You can use it to mount headers or just solder the parts in directly. All the solder pads are labeled.

### Pots
The labeling of the pots is not correct! I will add a detailed wiring guide soon!

## Instrument outs
All the "instruments" have a sngle out, which takes it out of the mix as well. These signals do not run through UM-TSS amp, so you will probably need to amplify them!
